**Team Next.js**
Welcome to the Team Next.js repository! This project is a tribute to the fantastic team I’m working with on our final project. It’s a simple Next.js application that features a display of our team members with their pictures and fun quotes. This project celebrates our collaboration and creativity as we work on our main project.

**Project Overview**
This project utilizes Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create a visually engaging section that displays team members. Each team member is shown with their name, a fun or humorous quote, and their image. This is designed to add a personal touch to our project and highlight our team’s spirit.
